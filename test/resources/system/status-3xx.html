      This class of status code 3xx indicates that further action needs to be
      taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request. The action required
      MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if
      and only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A client
      SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since such loops generate network
      traffic for each redirection.

      The requested resource has multiple possibilities, each with different locations.
