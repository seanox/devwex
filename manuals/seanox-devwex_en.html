        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is a minimalist runtime container with a modular
          architecture for (web)servers and applications. The included server
          implementation support HTTP with virtual hosting, filters, modules,
          SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory index, templates and a Telnet-base
          remote access to control the container.<br>
          Additional servers and modules/applications can be integrated via the
          available APIs. The runtime container and the servers are a pure Java
          implementation and can be used with the corresponding runtime
          environments on many operating systems.

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is a multithreaded runtime container for
          (server)modules, which are integrated via the provided Server and
          Module API. The own ClassLoader supports the loading and unloading of
          servers and modules at the runtime. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
        <p>
          The HTTP server implementation provides virtual hosting, filters,
          HTTP modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory index, templates and
          more.
        </p>
        <h2>Remote Control</h2>
        <p>
          The included remote access supports a telnet-based control of the
          runtime container (restart and stop) and queries about the operating
          status of running servers and modules.<br>
          In addition to the server implementation, a client implementation is
          also included.
        </p>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          The configuration uses a central file in an advanced INI format,
          divided into sections with keys and values, which supports multiple
          inheritance in the sections, dynamic values, and access to system and
          environment variables.
        </p>
        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <h3>Server API (SAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Server API integrates implementations that provide physical access
          to the network for a protocol at one address and one port, allowing
          existing server and network functionalities to be changed or new ones
          to be deployed.
        </p>
        <h3>Module API (XAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The module API integrates implementations that act in the background
          and do not provide direct external functions.
        </p>
        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>
          In accordance with specification 1.0, GET, POST and HEAD as well as
          OPTIONS PUT and DELETE are supported by HTTP 1.1 and other methods can
          be provided via HTTP modules, XCGI and CGI.
        </p>
        <h3>HTTP Module API (XAPI+)</h3>
        <p>
          The HTTP Module API is an extension of the Module API for the HTTP
          server to implement filter and service functions that run in the
          context of the server.
        </p>
        <h3>(Fast)CGI</h3>
        <p>
          For data exchange as well as for connecting external runtime
          environments and applications, the specification 1.1 of the Common
          Gateway Interface and thus PHP, Perl, Python and others are supported.
          FastCGI is also available as an option.
        </p>
        <h3>XCGI</h3>
        <p>
          The XCGI is an interface based on the CGI and has the same basic
          principle as the XCGI, which communicates via the standard I/O, but
          also transmits server-relevant information and environment variables
          in this way, so that applications can also be used which do not have
          an exclusive environment or do not have access to the environment
          variables of the operating system.
        </p>
        <h3>Telnet</h3>
        <p>
          The included remote access supports a telnet-based control of the
          container (restart and stop) and queries about the operating status of
          running servers and modules.<br>
          In addition to the server implementation, a client implementation is
          also included.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with
          server and client certificates are supported for secure data transfer,
          allowing certificates to be assigned to each physical host
          individually, by inheritance in groups or globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to directories and files can be provided with basic as well as
          digest access authentication, which supports groups and can be
          controlled by filters that support freely definable rules, individual
          error pages, automatic redirections and modules.
        </p>
        <h2>Virtualization</h2>
        <p>
          The HTTP server supports virtual hosting and aliasing for virtual
          paths.
        </p>
        <h2>Individuality</h2>
        <p>
          HTTP servers and virtual hosts use customizable templates for the
          error pages and list view of the directories (directory index). With
          support for CGI environment variables, the content can be designed
          dynamically.
        </p>
        <h2>Expandability</h2>
        <p>
          The modular architecture and many interfaces allow the modification,
          extension and addition of functionalities.

        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is provided as a ZIP archive and unpacked.<br>
          The unpacked directory structure is stored anywhere in the file
          system.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1>Configuration</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex uses a central configuration from the current working
          directory, which is pre-configured with the installation and stored in
          the program directory <code>./devwex/program</code> in the file
          <code>devwex.ini</code>. The configuration is divided into sections
          with keys and values, which also supports dynamic values and access to
          system and environment variables.
        </p>
        <h2>Configuration File</h2>
        <p>
          The INI format used is a compliant extension to the classic format,
          which is also line-based and uses sections where keys with values are
          stored, ignoring upper and lower case letters in the name of the
          section and key. Declarations of the same name cause the overriding of
          sections and keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections can be inherited in the extension, followed by the keyword
          <code>EXTENDS</code> followed by the names of the referenced sections,
          so that the section takes over all keys and values of the referenced
          sections and can expand or overwrite them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assigning values to keys in a section is done with the equal sign.
          Unlike to the original format, the assignment can be continued in the
          next line without having to repeat the key by using the plus sign.
          Values can also be fixed, variable and optionally assigned.<br>
          With the option <code>[?]</code> at the end of a key, the system
          searches for a key with the same name in the system properties of the
          Java runtime environment. If none can be determined, the optionally
          specified value is used. Without a value, such a key is not specified
          and is ignored. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Comments begin with a semicolon, are optional and can be used anywhere
          in a line, so the following characters are not part of section, key or
          value.<br>
          With the option <code>[+]</code> at the end of a key, the use of
          comments for that key can be disabled and the semicolon used in the
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections, keys and values also support a hexadecimal notation,
          starting with <code>0x...</code> followed by the hexadecimal string,
          which can only be used for the complete element.

            The section with the name <code>SECTION</code> is defined, the
            keyword <code>EXTENDS</code> refers to the derivation from the
            sections <code>SECTION-A</code> and <code>SECTION-B</code>. Thus,
            <code>SECTION</code> is based on the keys and values of the sections
            <code>SECTION-A</code> and <code>SECTION-B</code>. From the
            semicolon onwards, the following characters are interpreted as

        <h2>Initialisation</h2>
        <p>
          With the start and restart of Seanox Devwex, a general initialization
          of components is provided with the section
          <code>[INITIALIZE]</code>.<br>
          The components/extensions/modules entered here are initialized with
          the start or restart of the service and are informed about certain
          service events at runtime.
        </p>
        <header>
          Scheme for formulating the initialization:
        </header>
        <code>NAME = EXTENSION [OPTION] [OPTION] ...</code>
        <header>
          Example of initialization:
        </header>
        <pre>
          [INITIALIZE]
            CONTROL = com.seanox.devwex.control.Connector
            PHP     = com.seanox.fastcgi.Connector
                    + [connection:127.0.0.1:8129]
            CGI     = com.seanox.fastcgi.Connector
                    + [connection:127.0.0.1:8139] [*]
        </pre>
        <p>
          With the option <code>[*]</code> a module can be marked as
          optional.<br>
          If the module is not present during initialization, this option does
          not lead to an error output.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
          Servers are an essential part of Seanox Devwex and requires at least
          one successfully established server instance to run.<br>
          During initialization, all sections ending in <code>BAS</code> are
          considered and searched for a matching implementation in the Seanox
          Devwex ClassPath, the class name of the implementation is the first
          part of the section name before the first colon.
        </p>
        <pre>
          [CLASS:BAS]
            ...

          [CLASS:IDENTIFIER:BAS]
            ...
        </pre>
        <p>
          Optionally, the SCOPE key can be used to specify the package in which
          the class is located. com. seanox. devewx is used without this
          key.<br>
          If no implementation is found for a section ending on BAS, it will be
          ignored without an error message.
        </p>
        <pre>
          [CLASS:BAS]
            SCOPE = package.of.class
            ...

          [CLASS:IDENTIFIER:BAS]
            SCOPE = package.of.class
            ...
        </pre>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex includes an HTTP server and Telnet-based remote access
          to control the runtime container, the configuration and function of
          which is described in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h3>Remote Control</h3>
        <p>
          The included remote access supports a telnet-based control of the
          runtime container (restart and stop) and queries about the operating
          status of running servers and modules.<br>
          Alternatively, Seanox Devwex includes a compatible client
          implementation in addition to the server. The client implementation is
          configured in the command line with program arguments. For the server,
          the configuration is done in the <code>[REMOTE:BAS]</code> section of
          the configuration file.

        <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
        <p>
          The server and the protocol have many configuration options, which are
          divided into separate sub-sections, whose position and sequence is
          arbitrary. The sub-sections have the same name as the server section,
          but differ in the section identifier at the end.

        <h3>Transport Layer Security / Secure Socket Layer</h3>
        <p>
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) are
          supported for secure data transmission.<br>
          Both procedures are based on the use of certificates that are assigned
          to each physical host individually and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the management of public and private key pairs, as well as all
          certificates required to map a chain of trust and determine the
          trustworthiness of certificates, Java supports file-based keystores as
          key and certificate stores, among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Java distinguishes between the Keystrore, for private keys and
            certificates, and the Truststore, for CA certificates of trusted
            certification authorities.<br>
            With Seanox Devwex, this distinction is no longer necessary and so
            only one keystore is used for both.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The use of aliases in the keystore is possible, but is not supported
            by Seanox Devwex. Therefore, we recommend configuring dedicated
            keystores.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            TLS and SSL are part of the connection setup in Java and are
            therefore bound to physical hosts. This makes it difficult to use
            certificates for virtual hosts and only works for sub-domains. The
            use of physical hosts with virtual IP addresses is recommended for
            the provision of different domains.

          To create and manage keys and certificates, Oracle provides the
          Keytool utility.<br>
          Below, only the simple creation of self-created server certificates
          is described, for details on the utility, please refer to the
          documentation for the JRE used.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of how to create server certificates in the keystore:
        </header>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365
                             -alias Server -dname "CN=127.0.0.1"
                             -keystore keystore -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          If no target directory is specified with <code>-keystore</code> in the
          Keytool, the generated certificate is stored as <code>.keystore</code>
          file in the user directory. depending on the operating system,
          different user directories are used, e. g. with Windows this can be
          <code>C:\Users\&lt;Benutzer&gt;\.keystore</code> or with Unix-based
          system <code>/home/&lt;benutzer&gt;/.keystore</code>.<br>
          The created keystore file can be renamed arbitrarily and moved in the
          file system.
        </p>
        <h3>Client Authentication / Mutual Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          This type of authorization, which is activated via
          <code>CLIENTAUTH</code> is based on certificates. server and client
          negotiate the exchange of certificates during connection setup,
          accepting only certificates known to them.<br>
          The behavior of the server and the establishment of the connection can
          be set up here by <code>ON</code> strictly and with <code>AUTO</code>
          tolerant.<br>
          In case of strict conduct, the transmission of a valid certificate is
          required. Without it, the connection is closed without a response from
          the server.<br>
          In tolerant behavior, the connection is always established. In this
          case, it is up to the server configuration how the server behaves when
          no or no appropriate certificate is transmitted. Without further
          server configuration, the behaviour corresponds to the configuration
          <code>CLIENTAUTH = OFF</code>. However, the server can react to
          missing or unsuitable certificates via filters. If a client
          authenticates itself with a known certificate, the environment
          variable <code>AUTH_CERT</code> is provided with the certificate
          attributes. If the environment variable <code>AUTH_CERT</code> is not
          set or empty, a request without an appropriate certificate can be
          assumed and an error page can be sent to the client. 
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of a filter for checking for valid certificates:
        </header>
        <pre>
          [SERVER:X:SSL]
            ...
            CLIENTAUTH  = AUTO
            ...
          [SERVER:X:FLT]
            CLIENT-AUTH = ALL IS EMPTY AUTH_CERT
        </pre>
        <header>
          Server and client certificates can be created as follows:
        </header>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias Server -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365
                             -dname 'CN=Server'
                             -keystore server.jks -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -exportcert -alias Server -file server.cer
                             -keystore server.jks -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          The keystore for the client is created and the public client
          certificate is exported.<br>
          Both are temporary in this example and will be needed later on for the
          creation of the server keysore and the export of the client
          certificate.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias Client -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365
                             -dname 'CN=Client'
                             -keystore client.jks -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -exportcert -alias Client -file client.cer
                             -keystore client.jks -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          The keystores of the server and client are migrated to each other.<br>
          Thus only the server keystore is needed.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importcert -alias Client -file client.cer
                             -keystore server.jks -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importcert -alias Server -file server.cer
                             -keystore client.jks -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <p>
          Finally, the server and client certificates are exported as
          <code>PKCS12</code>.<br>
          The file <code>client.p12</code> is needed later for the client to
          authorize the server and the server certificate can be ignored.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importkeystore
                             -srckeystore server.jks -srcstorepass changeIt
                             -destkeystore server.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12
                             -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importkeystore -alias ClientA
                             -srckeystore client.jks -srcstorepass changeIt
                             -destkeystore client.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12
                             -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <h3>Virtual Hosts / Virtual Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          In virtual hosting, a server handles requests for different domains
          and/or hosts, with the server having a basic configuration that
          dynamically adapts to the request for a domain or host, changing the
          behavior of the server as if the request is received from a
          self-configured server.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of a request for a virtual host:
        </header>
        <pre>
          GET /directory/file.cgi?value=123 HTTP/1.1
          Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
          Accept-Language: de
          Accept: */*
          User-Agent: Browser
          Host: example.local
        </pre>
        <p>
          For this example, the virtual host sections must be created in the
          configuration file as follows.
        </p>
        <pre>
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:BAS]
            ...
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:FLT]
            ...
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:REF]
            ...
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:ACC]
            ...
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:ENV]
            ...
          [VIRTUAL:EXAMPLE.LOCAL:CGI]
            ...
        </pre>
        <p>
          The configuration of virtual hosts is the same as for HTTP
          servers.<br>
          The keys specific for network connections are: <code>ADDRESS</code>,
          <code>PORT</code>, <code>BACKLOG</code>, <code>ISOLATION</code> and
          <code>MAXACCESS</code> are omitted here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virtual hosts are stand-alone configurations that are primarily
          available to all servers.<br>
          With <code>[VIRTUAL:BAS] SERVER</code> the usage of the configuration
          can be limited to certain servers.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of restriction to individual servers:
        </header>
        <pre>
          [VIRTUAL:X:BAS]
            SERVER = SERVER:A SERVER:B SERVER:C
            ...
        </pre>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>
          The access to servers and virtual hosts can be controlled by
          individual rules, for which the incoming requests are checked against
          these rules before processing, and individual error pages, automatic
          redirections and modules are supported.
        </p>
        <header>
          Scheme for the formulation of the filters:
        </header>
        <pre>NAME = METHOD CONDITION FUNCTION VARIABLE VALUE [+] ... &gt; REFERENCE [R]</pre>
        <p>
          All CGI environment variables with their values are available to the
          filters in coded and decoded form, and upper and lower case letters
          are ignored for the variables as well as the values.

        <h3>Virtual Paths (Aliasing and Redirection)</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual paths are an alias for physical elements in a file system that
          can be used to build new file and directory structures or modify
          existing ones, regardless of the file system; in addition to the file
          system, modules and redirections are also supported as targets.
        </p>
        <section>
          <b>Important</b>
          <p>
            If the target is a relative path in the local file system, the path
            always refers to the execution directory of the server.

        <h3>Basic Access Authentication / Digest Access Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          Basic Access Authentication (BAA) and Digest Access Authentication
          (DAA) are two of the different methods by which a user can
          authenticate himself or herself against a web server or a web
          application, and the use of Digest Access Authentication is
          recommended here, since unlike Basic Access Authentication, this does
          not require a password to be entered directly, but only in the form of
          a checksum or a password to protect against reconstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The configuration of the Basic / Digest-Access-Authentication consists
          of a virtual or physical path in the section <code>[SERVER:REF]</code>
          or <code>[VIRTUAL:REF]</code>, where with <code>[acc:...]</code> the
          reference to the permissions and optionally the description to the
          area (Realm) and with the option <code>[D]</code> the use of
          Digest-Access-Authentication is defined.<br>
          A special function is <code>[acc:none]</code> because this value
          cancels the parent authorization for the specified path and all child
          paths. If other valid ACC references are specified in the same
          definition, <code>[acc:none]</code> is ignored.<br>
          The permissions are defined in the standalone section
          <code>[SERVER:ACC]</code> or <code>[VIRTUAL: ACC]</code> and consist
          of one or more groups with individual permissions, consisting of user
          and password.

        <h3>Environmental Variables</h3>
        <p>
          With environment variables, the operating system and runtime
          environment provide an application with essential and additional
          system and runtime information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an extension of the environment variables from the operating system
          and the runtime environment, additional environment variables required
          for the CGI and XCGI are defined in this section.

          Scheme for formulating the environment variables:
        </header>
        <pre>VARIABLE = VALUE</pre>
        <header>
          Examples of setting up environment variables:
        </header>
        <pre>WEBSERVER = DEVWEX</pre>
        <p>
          The environment variable <code>WEBSERVER</code> is defined with the
          value <code>DEVWEX</code>.
        </p>
        <section>
          <b>Hint</b>
          <p>
            XCGI/CGI applications determine system and runtime information about
            the environment variables, so essential environment variables such
            as <code>SYSTEMDRIVE</code>, <code>SYSTEMROOT</code>,
            <code>PATH</code> and for PHP <code>REDIRECT_STATUS = 302</code>
            should be set in the configuration file <code>devwex.ini</code>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <b>Tip</b>
          <p>
            The option <code>[?]</code> at the end of a key identifies it as
            dynamic by specifying the key with its value at program startup as a
            VM argument or in the environment variables, system variables such
            as <code>PATH</code> and for Windows <code>SYSTEMDRIVE</code> and
            <code>SYSTEMROOT</code> can be passed by this way, see section
            [#ConfigurationConfigurationFile] for more information.

        <h3>Common Gateway Interface</h3>
        <p>
          For data exchange as well as for connecting external runtime
          environments and applications, the specification 1.1 of the Common
          Gateway Interface and thus PHP, Perl, Python and others are supported.
          FastCGI is also available as an option.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the XCGI, another interface similar to the CGI is available. The
          basic principle and method of operation are the same as for CGI. The
          XCGI also communicates via the standard I/O and the server-relevant
          information is transmitted as environment variables. Here, however,
          the form of transmission differs. The environment variables for the
          CGI are provided via the runtime environment and for the XCGI via the
          data stream. Similar to the CGI, the XCGI transfers the request body
          via standard I/O. In the XCGI, the environment variables precede the
          request body. The structure is similar to that of the HTTP request.
          The data stream begins line by line with the environment variables,
          followed by the character string <code>[CRLFCRLF]</code> and then the
          request body. 
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of an XCGI request:
        </header>
        <pre>
          SERVER_PORT=80
          SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.0
          CONTENT_LENGTH=25
          CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          REQUEST=POST /example.xcgi HTTP/1.1
          REQUEST_METHOD=POST
          REMOTE_ADDR=127.0.0.1
          REMOTE_PORT=64638
          UNIQUE_ID=MHU014XLD048AN1A
          SCRIPT_NAME=/example.xcgi
          SCRIPT_URL=/example.xcgi
          HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
          HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0
          HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH=25
          SCRIPT_URI=http://127.0.0.1/example.xcgi
          SCRIPT_FILENAME=c:/xcgi/example.xcgi
          PATH_TRANSLATED=c:/xcgi/example.xcgi
          REQUEST_URI=/example.xcgi
          GATEWAY_INTERFACE=CGI/1.1

          Content of Request(-Body)
        </pre>
        <p>
          The advantage of the XCGI is the simple transmission of the
          environment variables, which means that applications can also be used
          that do not have an exclusive environment or do not have access to the
          environment variables of the operating system.

          In addition to XCGI and CGI, modules can also be set up via the
          gateway.<br>
          Unlike XCGI and CGI, modules are not loaded as external applications,
          but are executed directly in the runtime environment of the server via
          the module API (XAPI), which provides very fast access times and
          direct access to the components from the runtime container.

            The working directory of the CGI applications is the directory from
            which Seanox Devwex was started.<br>
            For example, if configuration files such as the <code>php.ini</code>
            are to be considered, they should be placed in the working directory
            of Seanox Devwex.

            As of version 4. x of PHP, configuration of parameter
            <code>cgi.rfc2616_headers = 1</code> is required for the correct
            function of PHP function <code>header();</code>, for the security of
            execution <code>cgi.force_redirect = 0</code> and those and

            Executable Windows applications (<code>*.exe</code>,

            alternative file extension, e.g. XCGI/CGI can be used as Windows
            applications (<code>*.exe</code> or <code>*.com</code>) for which
            any file extension can be used, e.g. the file
            <code>example.exe</code> can be renamed and used as

        <h2>Statuscodes</h2>
        <p>
          The server acknowledges all HTTP requests with a status code,
          informing the client about the processing of the request, primary the
          server status is a numeric value with an optional message.<br>
          Status codes are global and are used by all servers and virtual hosts.
        </p>
        <header>
          Formulation of a status code:
        </header>
        <code>
          CODE = TEXT
        </code>
        <header>
          Examples of status codes:
        </header>
        <code>
          404 = Document Not Found
        </code>
        <p>Header of the response:</p>
        <code>
          HTTP/1.0 404 Document Not Found
        </code>
        <h2>Mediatypes</h2>
        <p>
          The Mediatype, also known as Internet Media Type, Content Type and
          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME Type), classifies the data
          transmitted with the server response by assigning media types and
          subtypes.<br>
          In the configuration, the media types are assigned a list of file
          extensions separated by spaces, which is global and shared by all
          servers and virtual hosts.
        </p>
        <header>
          Scheme for the formulation of a media type:
        </header>
        <code>
          MediaType = file extension file extension ...
        </code>
        <header>
          Example of Mediatype assignment:
        </header>
        <code>
          text/html = html htm shtml
        </code>
        <p>
          The media type <code>text/html</code> is assigned to the file

          In addition to the command to be executed, other VM arguments can be
          passed to the program as properties or environment variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Properties are set in format <code>-Dproperty=value</code> directly on
          Java call.

          Environment variables are set in the operating system before the
          program is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, the VM arguments and the environment variables can then
          be used as dynamic keys in the configuration file
          <code>devwex.ini</code>. In this case, properties (VM arguments) have
          a higher priority than environment variables.

          <p>
            The VM arguments <code>argument1</code> and <code>argument2</code>
            are passed with the program call at startup, which can then be used
            in the Java implementation and in the configuration.<br>
            The VM arguments are available as dynamic keys in the configuration
            (see also [#ConfigurationConfigurationFile]).

        </section>
        <p>
          The argument <code>libraies</code> is a fixed part of the argument,
          which can be used to pass additional resources, libraries and classes
          whose paths are separated by the path separator defined for the
          operating system.<br>
          At startup, Seanox Devwex automatically adds all files specified in
          this way to its class path (ClassPath) as well as the files of the
          specified directories.

          <p>
            The VM argument <code>libraries</code> is passed with the program
            call at startup. This can then be used in the Java implementation
            and in the configuration.

          implementation of the runtime container and the server is a challenge
          to achieve maximum functionality with minimal resources and to
          maintain a clean architecture.

        <h2>Sequences</h2>
        <p>
          Starting, restarting and terminating the servers as well as loading,
          requesting and unloading modules are fixed sequences of the runtime
          container.
        </p>
        <h3>Start</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The class path is extended to include all files of the directories
            specified with the VM argument <code>-Dlibraries</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            All modules from section <code>INITIALIZE</code> are loaded and
            initialized and registered via constructor <code>Module(String
            options)</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            All servers are determined by searching for sections that end in
            <code>BAS</code> and to which an implementation can be found in the
            class path, which are loaded, registered, and initialized via
            constructor <code>Server(String name, Object initialize)</code>. To
            do this, each server is given the name of the detected section and a
            complete copy of the central configuration as an initialize object.
            After successful initialization, the server is started as a
            (Daemon)thread and can start its work in method
            <code>Server.run()</code>.

        <h3>Module Call</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the module is not yet loaded, this is determined from the current
            class path, initialized and registered via
            <code>Module(String options)</code>. A configuration is not passed,
            since only one central configuration is provided for modules in
            section <code>INITIALIZE</code>.

          <li>
            If the module is already loaded, the current instance is used.

        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        <p>
          The extension of Seanox Devwex is possible in several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service provides a server, module, and HTTP module API. Special
          interfaces and abstractions are not included in the service itself,
          which uses them and controls all servers and modules via reflections
          and silent standards/interfaces, which may require detailed knowledge
          of the components and operation of Seanox Devwex.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implementation with Seanox Commons as part of the Seanox Devwex
          SDK (for Seanox Devwex 5.x in development) is easier and more
          convenient. It contains the necessary interfaces and abstractions and
          provides additional ClassLoader layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following describes only the server, module, and HTTP module APIs
          contained in the service.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
          Servers provide physical access to the network for a protocol at one
          address and one port. Seanox Devwex integrates servers via the Server
          API (SAPI), which can also be used to modify or deploy existing
          server and network functionalities.
        </p>
        <h3>API (SAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The server API is based on the implementation of the runnable
          interface, initialization is done by the constructor and the server
          instances created are started by the runtime container (Service) with
          the method <code>Server.run()</code> and prompted to quit by
          <code>Service.destroy()</code>. The call of both methods is
          asynchronous, the runtime container waits for the end. Optionally, the
          implementation of method <code>Server.explain()</code> for querying
          general information such as protocol and network connection is
          supported.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <pre>
          public class Server implements Runnable {

              public Server(String name, Object initialize) {
                  ...

                  Der Server wird durch Seanox Devwex ber den Konstruktor
                  initiiert. Liegt dieser nicht vor, wird der Server als
                  inkompatible betrachtet und nicht geladen. Die Konfiguration
                  wird neben dem Namen als Initialize-Objekt bergeben.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the server in the following format:
                  &lt;PROTOCOL HOST-NAME:PORT&gt; or
                  &lt;PROTOCOL HOST-ADRESSE:PORT&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void run() {
                  ...

                  Der Server wird als (Daemon)Thread gestartet.
              }

              public void destroy {
                  ...

                  The module is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p>
          The extensions intended for background activities do not provide any
          direct external functions; they are identified by the class and
          loaded, initialized, and configured when starting or restarting from
          the service or at runtime in servers and modules via the
          Application-ClassLoader. Modules are global extensions that are
          provided once instantiated to all components.<br>
          Optionally, it is possible to use the context class loader from the
          Seanox Devwex SDK, so that modules can also be used in several
          independent instances with their own class loader.
        </p>
        <h3>API (XAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Module API only includes the initialization and termination of
          modules. The initialization is carried out via the constructor
          initially with the start of the runtime container (Service), whereby
          the sequence in the configuration file is determined with the sequence
          of the modules within the <code>INITIALIZE</code> section, or the
          initialization is carried out with the first request of a module at
          runtime. The configuration is only transferred to a module if it is
          initially loaded via the <code>INITIALIZE</code> section. The exit
          request is made using the method <code>Module.destroy()</code>. The
          runtime container does not actively monitor the termination and
          discards the modules by unloading them from the ClassLoader.
          Optionally, the implementation of the method
          <code>Module.explain()</code> for request general information, such
          as manufacturer and version, is supported. 
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <pre>
          public class Module {

              public Module(String options) {
                  ...

                  The module is initiated via this constructor. If this is not
                  available, the module is considered incompatible with the API
                  and is not loaded. The configuration is optional and will only
                  be transferred from the[INITIALIZE] section if initiated
                  centrally.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the module in the following format:
                  &lt;PRODUCER-MODULE/VERSION&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void destroy() {
                  ...

                  The module is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h2>HTTP Modules</h2>
        <p>
          HTTP Modules are an extension of the Seanox Devwex Module API
          specifically designed for filtering, accepting and processing HTTP
          requests that run in the context of the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP modules allow you to implement filter and service
          functionalities, which is described in detail below, based on
          individual implementations that can also be combined in an HTTP
          module.
        </p>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>
          Access to the physical and virtual hosts can be controlled by
          specially defined rules: In addition to forwarding and responding to
          requests with a defined server status, processing can also be passed
          to a filter.<br>
          Filters are intended for checking specific requests and, if necessary,
          manipulating incoming requests; they should only have access to the
          request header if the request is not completely processed by the
          filter.
        </p>
        <h4>API (XAPI+)</h4>
        <p>
          The API corresponds to the Module API, which is extended by
          <code>Module.filter(Worker worker, String options)</code>. The passed
          worker is the request processing instance and has access to the
          server, socket, request, response, configuration and environment. With
          the configuration you can set further parameters and options for a
          filter, which are then optionally passed as a string.
        </p>
        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <pre>
          public class Module {

              public Module(String options) {
                  ...

                  The module is initiated via this constructor. If this is not
                  available, the module is considered incompatible with the API
                  and is not loaded. The configuration is optional and will only
                  be transferred from the[INITIALIZE] section if initiated
                  centrally.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the module in the following format:
                  &lt;PRODUCER-MODULE/VERSION&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void filter(Worker worker, String options) {
                  ...

                  This method takes over the check and, if necessary, the
                  manipulation of the request or processes and completely
                  answers it. If the request is to be answered with a server
                  status only, the filter method can set it and does not have to
                  answer the request itself. In this case, the answer is
                  provided by the downstream worker implementation.
              }

              public void destroy() {
                  ...

                  The module is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h3>Service</h3>
        <p>
          The target of an HTTP request these are directories, files and dynamic
          content from external CGI and XCGI applications that are requested via
          virtual paths.<br>
          Services provide another form of dynamic content. These take over the
          complete processing of incoming requests and have unrestricted access.
        </p>
        <h4>API (XAPI+)</h4>
        <p>
          The API corresponds to the Module API, which is extended by
          <code>Module.service(Worker worker, String options)</code>. The passed
          worker is the request processing instance and has access to the
          server, socket, request, response, configuration and environment. With
          the configuration, further parameters and options can be set for a
          module, which are then optionally passed as a string.

                  not have to answer the request itself. In this case, the

        <h2>Development Environment (SDK)</h2>
        <p>
          For development and experimenting with Seanox Devwex, a special
          development environment (SDK) is available (for Seanox Devwex 5.x in
          development). The completely pre-configured project for the Eclipse
          IDE includes Seanox Devwex, Seanox Devwex Test, Seanox Commons and
          Seanox Devwex WebSocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to a comprehensive API, including the necessary interfaces
          as well as abstractions and additional ClassLoader layers for the
          development with Seanox Devwex, many functional examples are also
          included. Detailed documentation is included with the development
          environment.
