Description
====
Seanox Devwex is a minimalist runtime container with a modular architecture for
(web) servers and applications. The included server instances support HTTP with
virtual hosting, filters, modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory index,
templates and a telnet-based remote access to container control. Additional
servers and modules/applications can be integrated via the available APIs. The
runtime container with the servers is a pure Java implementation and can be used
on many operating systems due to the corresponding runtime environments.
