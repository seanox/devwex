# Description

Seanox Devwex is a minimalist runtime container with a modular architecture for
(web)servers and applications. The included server implementation support HTTP
with virtual hosting, filters, modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory listing,
templates and a Telnet-base remote access to control the container. Further
servers and modules as well as applications can be integrated via the available
APIs. The runtime container and the included servers are pure Java
implementations and can be used on many operating systems with the appropriate
runtime environment.
