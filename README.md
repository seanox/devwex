======

A minimalistic web server with a modular architecture. The already contained servers
instances support the HTTP amongst others virtual hosts, IP/Port sharing, file listing, 
filter, modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1 and a on telnet based remote access to control
the server. Further servers and modules can be integrated about the available APIs.
The server is a pure Java implementation for the command line and can be used with
an appropriate Java runtime environment on many operating systems.
