        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is a minimalist runtime container with a modular
          architecture for (web)servers and applications. The included server
          implementation support HTTP with virtual hosting, filters, modules,
          SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory listing, templates and a Telnet-base
          remote access to control the container.<br>
          Further servers and modules as well as applications can be integrated
          via the available APIs. The runtime container and the included servers
          are pure Java implementations and can be used on many operating
          systems with the appropriate runtime environment.

        <h1>Features</h1>
        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is a multithreaded runtime container for (server)
          modules. for (server) modules, which are integrated via the provided
          server and module and modules API provided. In addition, the
          ClassLoader supports the loading and unloading of servers and modules
          at runtime. at runtime.
        </p>
        <h2>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h2>
        <p>
          The HTTP server implementation supports virtual hosting, filters, HTTP
          modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, directory listing, templates, among
          others.
        </p>
        <h2>Remote Control</h2>
        <p>
          The included remote access supports a telnet-based control of the
          runtime container (restart and stop) and queries about the operating
          status of running servers and modules.<br>
          In addition to the server implementation, a client implementation is
          also included.
        </p>
        <h2>Configuration</h2>
        <p>
          The configuration uses a central file in an advanced INI format,
          divided into sections with keys and values, which supports multiple
          inheritance in the sections, dynamic values, and access to system and
          environment variables.
        </p>
        <h2>Interfaces</h2>
        <h3>Server API (SAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Server API integrates implementations that provide physical access
          to the network for a protocol at one address and one port, allowing
          existing server and network functionalities to be changed or new ones
          to be deployed.
        </p>
        <h3>Module API (XAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Module API integrates implementations that act in the background
          and do not provide direct external functions.
        </p>
        <h3>HTTP</h3>
        <p>
          In accordance with specification 1.0, GET, POST and HEAD as well as
          OPTIONS PUT and DELETE are supported by HTTP 1.1 and other methods can
          be provided via HTTP modules, XCGI and CGI.
        </p>
        <h3>HTTP Module API (XAPI+)</h3>
        <p>
          The HTTP Module API is an extension of the Module API for the HTTP
          server to implement filter and service functions that run in the
          context of the server.
        </p>
        <h3>(Fast)CGI</h3>
        <p>
          For data exchange as well as for connecting external runtime
          environments and applications, the specification 1.1 of the Common
          Gateway Interface and thus PHP, Perl, Python and others are supported.
          FastCGI is also available as an option.
        </p>
        <h3>XCGI</h3>
        <p>
          The XCGI is an interface based on the CGI and has the same basic
          principle to communicate via the standard I/O, but also transmits
          server-relevant information and environment variables in this way, so
          that applications can also be used which do not have an exclusive
          environment or do not have access to the environment variables of the
          operating system. 
        </p>
        <h3>Telnet</h3>
        <p>
          The runtime container can be controlled via Telnet (restart and stop)
          and the operating status to the running servers and modules can be
          queried. In addition to the implementation of the server, a client is
          also included.
        </p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) with
          server and client certificates are supported for secure data transfer,
          allowing certificates to be assigned to each physical host
          individually, by inheritance in groups or globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to directories and files can be provided with basic as well as
          digest access authentication, which supports groups and can be
          controlled by filters that support freely definable rules, individual
          error pages, automatic redirections and modules.
        </p>
        <h2>Virtualization</h2>
        <p>
          The HTTP server supports virtual hosting and aliasing for virtual
          paths.
        </p>
        <h2>Individuality</h2>
        <p>
          HTTP servers and virtual hosts use customizable templates for the
          error pages and list view of the directories (directory listing). With
          support for CGI environment variables, the content can be designed
          dynamically.
        </p>
        <h2>Expandability</h2>
        <p>
          The modular architecture and many interfaces allow the modification,
          extension and addition of functionalities.

        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex is delivered as a ZIP archive that is unpacked at any
          location in the file system.
        </p>
        <h2>Windows Service</h2>
        <p>
          For Windows, a distribution of Seanox Devwex with <a target="_extern"
              href="https://commons.apache.org/daemon/procrun.html">Procrun</a>
          is available, which installs Seanox Devwex in Windows as a service.
          The distribution is based on the Java version and contains in
          additional additionally the service runners for 32 and 64 bit as well
          the batch file <code>service.cmd</code> for easy usage of the service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also the Windows distribution is unpacked at an arbitrary place in the
          file system. Because the service should run with a Windows service
          account and appropriate access rights, a place outside the user
          profiles is recommended for unpacking and installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, the service is installed with the Windows service account
          <code>NetworkService</code>, but other service accounts can also be
          used. The access rights required for the program directory are set
          during installation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parameters to configure the service have been bundled in the batch
          file and are easily accessible.
        </p>        
        <p>
          To install the service, the batch file <code>service.cmd</code> is
          used. To do this, open the console (shell/command prompt) as
          administrator and change to the program directory
          <code>./devwex/program</code> and call the batch file with the desired
          function.

          <b>Hint</b>
          <p>
            The distribution does not contain a JRE.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an already installed or in the system available one should be
            used, the Java home can be specified in <code>service.cmd</code>
            with the variable <code>java</code>. Alternatively, the JRE can also
            be placed in <code>./runtime/java</code>. In this case the batch
            script will find the JRE automatically.

        <h1>Configuration</h1>
        <p>
          Seanox Devwex uses a central configuration in the current working
          directory, which is pre-configured with the installation and stored in
          the program directory <code>./devwex/program</code> in the file
          <code>devwex.ini</code>. The configuration is divided into sections
          with keys and values, which also supports dynamic values and access to
          system and environment variables.
        </p>
        <h2>Configuration File</h2>
        <p>
          The INI format used is a compliant extension to the classic format,
          which is also line-based and uses sections where keys with values are
          stored, ignoring upper and lower case letters in the name of the
          section and key. Declarations of the same name cause the overriding of
          sections and keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections can be inherited in the extension, followed by the keyword
          <code>EXTENDS</code> followed by the names of the referenced sections,
          so that the section takes over all keys and values of the referenced
          sections and can expand or overwrite them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assigning values to keys in a section is done with the equal sign.
          Unlike to the original format, the assignment can be continued in the
          next line without having to repeat the key by using the plus sign.
          Values can also be fixed, variable and optionally assigned.<br>
          With the option <code>[?]</code> at the end of a key, the system
          searches for a key with the same name in the system properties of the
          Java runtime environment. If none can be determined, the optionally
          specified value is used. Without a value, such a key is not specified
          and is ignored. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Comments begin with a semicolon, are optional and can be used anywhere
          in a line, so the following characters are not part of section, key or
          value.<br>
          With the option <code>[+]</code> at the end of a key, the use of
          comments for that key can be disabled and the semicolon used in the
          value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sections, keys and values also support a hexadecimal notation,
          starting with <code>0x...</code> followed by the hexadecimal string,
          which can only be used for the complete element.

            The section with the name <code>SECTION</code> is defined, the
            keyword <code>EXTENDS</code> refers to the derivation from the
            sections <code>SECTION-A</code> and <code>SECTION-B</code>. Thus,
            <code>SECTION</code> is based on the keys and values of the sections
            <code>SECTION-A</code> and <code>SECTION-B</code>. From the
            semicolon onwards, the following characters are interpreted as

        <h2>Initialisation</h2>
        <p>
          With the start and restart of Seanox Devwex, a general initialization
          of components is provided with the section
          <code>[INITIALIZE]</code>.<br>
          The components/extensions/modules entered here are initialized with
          the start or restart of the service and are informed about certain
          service events at runtime.
        </p>
        <header>
          Scheme for formulating the initialization:
        </header>
        <code>NAME = EXTENSION [OPTION] [OPTION] ...</code>
        <header>
          Example of initialization:
        </header>
        <pre>
          [INITIALIZE]
            CONTROL = com.seanox.devwex.control.Connector
            PHP     = com.seanox.fastcgi.Connector
                    + [connection:127.0.0.1:8129]
            CGI     = com.seanox.fastcgi.Connector
                    + [connection:127.0.0.1:8139] [*]
        </pre>
        <p>
          With the option <code>[*]</code> a module can be marked as
          optional.<br>
          If the module is not present during initialization, this option does
          not cause to an error output.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
          Servers are an essential part of Seanox Devwex and requires at least
          one successfully established server instance to run.<br>
          During initialization, all sections ending in <code>INI</code> are
          considered and searched for a matching implementation in the Seanox
          Devwex ClassPath, the class name of the implementation is the first
          part of the section name before the first colon.
        </p>
        <pre>
          [CLASS:INI]
            SCOPE = package.of.class
            ...

          [NAME:INI]
            SCOPE = package.of.class.Implementation

            SCOPE = package.of.class.Implementation
            ...
        </pre>
        <p>
          Optionally, the SCOPE key can be used to specify the package in which
          the class is located or the fully qualified class. Without this key,
          the default package com.seanox.devewx is used and the class name is
          derived from the section name.<br>
          If no implementation is found for a section ending on INI, it will be
          ignored without an error message.
        </p>
        <pre>

          Seanox Devwex already has an HTTP server and Telnet-based remote
          control implemented, the configuration and function of which are
          described in the following sections.
        </p>
        <h3>Remote Control</h3>
        <p>
          The included remote access supports a telnet-based control of the
          runtime container (restart and stop) and queries about the operating
          status of running servers and modules.<br>
          Alternatively, Seanox Devwex includes a compatible client
          implementation in addition to the server. The client implementation is
          configured in the command line with program arguments. For the server,
          the configuration is done in the <code>[REMOTE:INI]</code> section of
          the configuration file.

        <h3>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</h3>
        <p>
          The server and the protocol have many configuration options, which are
          divided into separate sub-sections, whose position and sequence is
          arbitrary. The sub-sections have the same name as the server section,
          but differ in the section identifier at the end.

        <h3>Transport Layer Security / Secure Socket Layer</h3>
        <p>
          Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) are
          supported for secure data transmission.<br>
          Both procedures are based on the use of certificates that are assigned
          to each physical host individually and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the management of public and private key, as well as all
          certificates required to map a chain of trust and determine the
          trustworthiness of certificates, Java supports file-based keystores as
          key and certificate stores, among other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Java distinguishes between the Keystrore, for private keys and
            certificates, and the Truststore, for CA certificates of trusted
            certification authorities.<br>
            With Seanox Devwex, this distinction is no longer necessary and so
            only one keystore is used for both.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The use of aliases in the keystore is possible, but is not supported
            by Seanox Devwex. Therefore, we recommend configuring dedicated
            keystores.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            TLS and SSL are part of the connection setup with Java and are
            therefore bound to physical hosts. The use of certificates for
            virtual hosts is thus made more difficult and works with
            certificates that have the virtual host entered as an alternative
            applicant name (DNS name).

          To create and manage keys and certificates, Oracle provides the
          Keytool utility.<br>
          Below, only the simple creation of self-created server certificates
          is described, for details on the utility, please refer to the
          documentation for the JRE used.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of how to create a server certificate in the keystore:
        </header>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 365
                             -alias Server -dname "CN=127.0.0.1"
                             -keystore keystore -keypass changeIt -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          If no target directory is specified with <code>-keystore</code> in the
          Keytool, the generated certificate is stored as <code>.keystore</code>
          file in the user directory. depending on the operating system,
          different user directories are used, e. g. with Windows this can be
          <code>C:\Users\&lt;User&gt;\.keystore</code> or with Unix-based
          system <code>/home/&lt;user&gt;/.keystore</code>.<br>
          The created keystore file can be renamed arbitrarily and moved in the
          file system.
        </p>
        <h3>Client Authentication / Mutual Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          This type of authorization, which is activated via
          <code>CLIENTAUTH</code> is based on certificates. server and client
          negotiate the exchange of certificates during connection setup,
          accepting only certificates known to them.<br>
          The behavior of the server and the establishment of the connection can
          be set up here by <code>ON</code> strictly and with <code>AUTO</code>
          tolerant.<br>
          In case of strict conduct, the transmission of a valid certificate is
          required. Without it, the connection is closed without a response from
          the server.<br>
          In tolerant behavior, the connection is always established. In this
          case, it is up to the server configuration how the server behaves when
          no or no appropriate certificate is transmitted. Without further
          server configuration, the behaviour corresponds to the configuration
          <code>CLIENTAUTH = OFF</code>. However, the server can react to
          missing or unsuitable certificates via filters. If a client
          authenticates itself with a known certificate, the environment
          variable <code>AUTH_CERT</code> is provided with the certificate
          attributes. If the environment variable <code>AUTH_CERT</code> is not
          set or empty, a request without an appropriate certificate can be
          assumed and an error page can be sent to the client. 
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of a filter for checking for valid certificates:
        </header>
        <pre>
          [SERVER:X:SSL]
            ...
            CLIENTAUTH  = AUTO
            ...
          [SERVER:X:FLT]
            CLIENT-AUTH = ALL IS EMPTY AUTH_CERT
        </pre>
        <header>
          Server and client certificates can be created as follows:
        </header>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias Server -dname 'CN=Server' -validity 365
                             -keystore server.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keypass changeIt
                             -storetype PKCS12 -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -exportcert -alias Server -file server.cer
                             -keystore server.keystore -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          The keystore for the client is created and the public client
          certificate is exported.<br>
          Both are temporary in this example and will be needed later on for the
          creation of the server keystore and the export of the client
          certificate.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -genkeypair -alias Client -dname 'CN=Client' -validity 365 
                             -keystore client.keystore -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -keypass changeIt
                             -storetype PKCS12 -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -exportcert -alias Client -file client.cer
                             -keystore client.keystore -storepass changeIt
        </pre>
        <p>
          The keystores of the server and client are migrated to each other.<br>
          Thus only the server keystore is needed.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importcert -alias Client -file client.cer
                             -keystore server.keystore -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importcert -alias Server -file server.cer
                             -keystore client.keystore -storepass changeIt
                             -noprompt
        </pre>
        <p>
          Finally, the server and client certificates are exported as
          <code>PKCS12</code>.<br>
          The file <code>client.p12</code> is needed later for the client to
          authorize the server and the server certificate can be ignored.
        </p>
        <pre>
          ./java/bin/keytool -importkeystore
                             -srckeystore server.keystore -srcstorepass changeIt
                             -destkeystore server.p12 -deststoretype PKCS12

        <h3>Virtual Hosts / Virtual Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          In virtual hosting, a server handles requests for different domains
          and/or hosts, with the server having a basic configuration that
          dynamically adapts to the request for a domain or host, changing the
          behavior of the server as if the request is received from a
          self-configured server.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of a request for a virtual host:
        </header>
        <pre>
          GET /directory/file.cgi?value=123 HTTP/1.1
          Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
          Accept-Language: de
          Accept: */*
          User-Agent: Browser
          Host: example.local
        </pre>
        <p>
          For this example, the virtual host sections must be created in the
          configuration file as follows.

          The configuration of virtual hosts is the same as for HTTP
          servers.<br>
          The keys specific for network connections are: <code>ADDRESS</code>,
          <code>PORT</code>, <code>BACKLOG</code> and <code>MAXACCESS</code> are
          omitted here.

        <p>
          Virtual hosts are stand-alone configurations that are primarily
          available to all servers.<br>
          With <code>[VIRTUAL:INI] SERVER</code> the usage of the configuration
          can be limited to certain servers.

        <h3>Virtual Paths (Aliasing and Redirection)</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual paths are an alias for physical elements in a file system that
          can be used to build new file and directory structures or modify
          existing ones, regardless of the file system; in addition to the file
          system, modules and redirections are also supported as targets.
        </p>
        <section>
          <b>Important</b>
          <p>
            If the target is a relative path in the local file system, the path
            always refers to the execution directory of the server.
          </p>

          Scheme for the formulation of virtual paths:
        </header>
        <pre>NAME = VIRTUAL PATH &gt; TARGET [OPTION]</pre>
        <p>
          The specification of a target is mandatory only for modules and
          redirections.<br>
          Real paths to which only additional options are assigned can be used
          without targets.

        <h3>Basic Access Authentication / Digest Access Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          Basic Access Authentication (BAA) and Digest Access Authentication
          (DAA) are two of the different methods by which a user can
          authenticate himself or herself against a web server or a web
          application, and the use of Digest Access Authentication is
          recommended here, since unlike Basic Access Authentication, this does
          not require a password to be entered directly, but only in the form of
          a checksum or a password to protect against reconstruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The configuration of the Basic / Digest Access Authentication consists
          of a virtual or physical path in the section <code>[SERVER:REF]</code>
          or <code>[VIRTUAL:REF]</code> in combination with the option
          <code>[acc:...]</code> as reference to the permissions and optionally
          with the options <code>[realm:...]</code> for the description of the
          area and <code>[D]</code> for the use of Digest Access
          Authentication.<br>
          With <code>[acc:none]</code>, the parent authorization for the
          specified path and all subordinate paths can be cancelled and, if
          necessary, further authorizations in deeper sub-directories can be
          used again.<br>
          The permissions are defined in the independent section
          <code>[SERVER:ACC]</code> or <code>[VIRTUAL:ACC]</code> and consist of
          one or more groups with individual permissions, consisting of user and
          password.

        <h3>Directory Listing</h3>
        <p>
        
          The content of directory listings is based on the template file
          <code>./devwex/system/index.html</code>.<br>
          Through the configuration of <code>SYSROOT</code>, the directory and
          thus the template can be individually defined for servers and virtual
          hosts.<br>
          The template is pure HTML combined with placeholders for the template
          generator. The syntax of the placeholders <code>#[...]</code> is
          case-insensitive, must begin with a letter and is limited to the
          following characters: <code>a-z A-Z 0-9 _-</code>.<br>
          Placeholders can be used for single values and segments.<br>
          Segments are partial structures that can be nested. The placeholders
          of segments are retained after filling and can be reused
          iteratively.<br>
          As values for segments, collections and maps are expected. Both create
          deep, complex and possibly repetitive recursive structures.
        </p>
        <header>
          Structure and description of the placeholders:

            <td>
              Defines a segment. The nesting and use of further segments is
              possible.<br>
              Because the placeholders of segments are retained, they can be
              used to generate lists.

        <h3>Environmental Variables</h3>
        <p>
          With environment variables, the operating system and runtime
          environment provide an application with essential and additional
          system and runtime information.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an extension of the environment variables from the operating system

          <p>
            XCGI/CGI applications determine system and runtime information about
            the environment variables, so essential environment variables such
            as <code>SYSTEMDRIVE</code>, <code>SYSTEMROOT</code>,
            <code>PATH</code> and for PHP <code>REDIRECT_STATUS = 302</code>
            should be set in the configuration file <code>devwex.ini</code>.

            VM argument or in the environment variables, system variables such
            as <code>PATH</code> and for Windows <code>SYSTEMDRIVE</code> and
            <code>SYSTEMROOT</code> can be passed by this way, see section
            [#ConfigurationConfigurationFile] for more information.

        <h3>Common Gateway Interface</h3>
        <p>
          For data exchange as well as for connecting external runtime
          environments and applications, the specification 1.1 of the Common
          Gateway Interface and thus PHP, Perl, Python and others are supported.
          FastCGI is also available as an option.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the XCGI, another interface similar to the CGI is available. The
          basic principle and method of operation are the same as for CGI. The
          XCGI also communicates via the standard I/O and the server-relevant
          information is transmitted as environment variables. Here, however,
          the form of transmission differs. The environment variables for the
          CGI are provided via the runtime environment and for the XCGI via the
          data stream. Similar to the CGI, the XCGI transfers the request body
          via standard I/O. In the XCGI, the environment variables precede the
          request body. The structure is similar to that of the HTTP request.
          The data stream begins line by line with the environment variables,
          followed by the character string <code>[CRLFCRLF]</code> and then the
          request body. 
        </p>
        <header>
          Example of an XCGI request:
        </header>
        <pre>
          SERVER_PORT=80
          SERVER_PROTOCOL=HTTP/1.0
          CONTENT_LENGTH=25
          CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          REQUEST=POST /example.xcgi HTTP/1.1
          REQUEST_METHOD=POST
          REMOTE_ADDR=127.0.0.1
          REMOTE_PORT=64638
          UNIQUE_ID=MHU014XLD048AN1A
          SCRIPT_NAME=/example.xcgi
          SCRIPT_URL=/example.xcgi
          HTTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
          HTTP_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0
          HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE=application/x-www-form-urlencoded
          HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH=25
          SCRIPT_URI=http://127.0.0.1/example.xcgi
          SCRIPT_FILENAME=c:/xcgi/example.xcgi
          PATH_TRANSLATED=c:/xcgi/example.xcgi

          GATEWAY_INTERFACE=CGI/1.1

          Content of Request(-Body)
        </pre>
        <p>
          The advantage of the XCGI is the simple transmission of the
          environment variables, which means that applications can also be used
          that do not have an exclusive environment or do not have access to the
          environment variables of the operating system.

          In addition to XCGI and CGI, modules can also be set up via the
          gateway.<br>
          Unlike XCGI and CGI, modules are not loaded as external applications,
          but are executed directly in the runtime environment of the server via
          the Module API (XAPI), which provides very fast access times and
          direct access to the components from the runtime container.

            The working directory of the CGI applications is the directory from
            which Seanox Devwex was started, which may need to be taken into
            consideration when configuring the CGI applications, e.g. if paths
            for resources and configuration files needs to be defined, as with
            PHP for <code>php.ini</code>.

          <p>
            With the installation of PHP, the configuration file
            <code>php.ini</code> must be placed in the working directory of

            communicated to PHP.

          <p>
            In PHP, configuration of parameter
            <code>cgi.rfc2616_headers = 1</code> is required for the correct
            function of PHP function <code>header();</code>, for the security of
            execution <code>cgi.force_redirect = 0</code> and those and
            <code>cgi.redirect_status_env = 302</code>.

            Executable Windows applications (<code>*.exe</code>,

            alternative file extension, e.g. XCGI/CGI can be used as Windows
            applications (<code>*.exe</code> or <code>*.com</code>) for which
            any file extension can be used, e.g. the file
            <code>example.exe</code> can be renamed and used as
            <code>example.cgi</code>. The configuration is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>CGI = POST GET &gt; [C]</pre>

        <h2>Status Codes</h2>
        <p>
          The server answers all HTTP requests with a status code and informs
          the client about the processing of the requests.Primary the server
          status is a numeric value with an optional message.<br>
          Status codes are global and are used by all servers and virtual hosts.

        <h2>Media Types</h2>
        <p>
          The media type, also known as Internet Media Type, Content Type and
          Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME Type), classifies the data
          transmitted with the server response by assigning media types and
          subtypes.<br>
          In the configuration, the media types are assigned a list of file
          extensions separated by spaces, which is global and shared by all
          servers and virtual hosts.
        </p>
        <header>
          Scheme for the formulation of a media type:

        <header>

        <code>
          text/html = html htm shtml
        </code>
        <p>
          The media type <code>text/html</code> is assigned to the file

        <p>
          In addition to the command to be executed, other VM arguments can be
          passed to the program as properties or environment variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          Properties are set in format <code>-Dproperty=value</code> directly on
          Java call.
        </p>
        <p>
          Environment variables are set in the operating system before the
          program is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, the VM arguments and the environment variables can then
          be used as dynamic keys in the configuration file
          <code>devwex.ini</code>. In this case, properties (VM arguments) have
          a higher priority than environment variables.
        </p>
        <header>
          Example for passing VM arguments with the program call:
        </header>
        <section>
          <pre>java -cp devwex.jar -Dargument1=value1 -Dargument2=value2 com.seanox.devwex.Service start</pre>
          <p>
            The VM arguments <code>argument1</code> and <code>argument2</code>
            are passed with the program call at startup, which can then be used
            in the Java implementation and in the configuration.<br>
            The VM arguments are available as dynamic keys in the configuration
            (see also [#ConfigurationConfigurationFile]).
          </p>
        </section>
        <p>
          The argument <code>libraries</code> is a fixed part of the argument,
          which can be used to pass additional resources, libraries and classes
          whose paths are separated by the path separator defined for the
          operating system.<br>
          At startup, Seanox Devwex automatically adds all files specified in
          this way to its class path (ClassPath) as well as the files of the
          specified directories.
        </p>
        <header>

          <pre>java -cp devwex.jar -Dlibraries="../libraries" com.seanox.devwex.Service start</pre>
          <p>
            The VM argument <code>libraries</code> is passed with the program
            call at startup. This can then be used in the Java implementation
            and in the configuration.

            or <code>Server(String name, Object initialize)</code>. To do this,
            each server is given the name of the detected section and a complete
            copy of the central configuration as an initialize object. After
            successful initialization, the server is started as a daemon/thread
            and can start its work in method <code>Server.run()</code>.

        <h3>Module Call</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the module is not yet loaded, this is determined from the current
            class path, initialized and registered via <code>Module(String
                options)</code>. A configuration is not passed, since only one
            central configuration is provided for modules in section
            <code>INITIALIZE</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the module is already loaded, the current instance is used.

        <h2>Expansion</h2>
        <p>
          The extension of Seanox Devwex is possible in several ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The service provides a Server API, Module API, and HTTP Module API.
          Special interfaces and abstractions are not included in the service
          itself, which uses them and controls all servers and modules via
          reflections and silent standards/interfaces, which may require
          detailed knowledge of the components and operation of Seanox Devwex.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implementation with Seanox Commons as part of the Seanox Devwex
          SDK (for Seanox Devwex 5.x in development) is easier and more
          convenient. It contains the necessary interfaces and abstractions and
          provides additional ClassLoader layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following describes only the Server API, Module API, and HTTP
          Module API contained in the service.
        </p>
        <h2>Server</h2>
        <p>
          Servers provide physical access to the network for a protocol at one
          address and one port. Seanox Devwex integrates servers via the Server
          API (SAPI), which can also be used to modify or deploy existing
          server and network functionalities.
        </p>
        <h3>API (SAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Server API is based on the implementation of the Runnable
          interface. The initialization takes place via the constructor
          <code>Server(String name, Initialize initialize)</code> or 
          <code>Server(String name, Object initialize)</code>. The order of
          initialization is determined by the order of the server configurations
          in the configuration file.<br>
          The created server instances are started by the runtime container
          (service) with the method <code>Server.run()</code> and are requested
          to terminate by <code>Service.destroy()</code>. Both methods are
          called asynchronously. If the termination is delayed, the runtime
          container waits for all registered server instances to finish.
          Optionally, the implementation of the <code>Server.explain()</code>
          method for querying general information, such as protocol and network
          connection, is supported. 
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <pre>
          public class Server implements Runnable {

              public Server(String name, Initialize initialize) {
              
                  or 
              
              public Server(String name, Object initialize) {
                  ...

                  The server is initiated by Seanox Devwex via the constructor.
                  If the constructor is not available, the server is considered
                  incompatible and is not loaded. The configuration is passed
                  next to the name as an Initialize object.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the server in the following format:
                  &lt;PROTOCOL HOST-NAME:PORT&gt; or
                  &lt;PROTOCOL HOST-ADDRESS:PORT&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void run() {
                  ...

                  The server will be started as a (daemon) thread.
              }

              public void destroy {
                  ...

                  The server is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p>
          The extensions intended for background activities do not provide any
          direct external functions; they are identified by the class and
          loaded, initialized, and configured when starting or restarting from
          the service or at runtime in servers and modules via the
          Application-ClassLoader. Modules are global extensions that are
          provided once instantiated to all components.<br>
          Optionally, it is possible to use the context class loader from the
          Seanox Devwex SDK, so that modules can also be used in several
          independent instances with their own class loader.
        </p>
        <h3>API (XAPI)</h3>
        <p>
          The Module API only includes the initialization and termination of
          modules. The initialization is carried out via the constructor
          initially with the start of the runtime container (Service), whereby
          the sequence in the configuration file is determined with the sequence
          of the modules within the <code>INITIALIZE</code> section, or the
          initialization is carried out with the first request of a module at
          runtime. The configuration is only transferred to a module if it is
          initially loaded via the <code>INITIALIZE</code> section. The exit
          request is made using the method <code>Module.destroy()</code>. The
          runtime container does not actively monitor the termination and
          discards the modules by unloading them from the ClassLoader.
          Optionally, the implementation of the method
          <code>Module.explain()</code> for request general information, such
          as manufacturer and version, is supported. 
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <pre>
          public class Module {

              public Module(String options) {
                  ...

                  The module is initiated via this constructor. If this is not
                  available, the module is considered incompatible with the API
                  and is not loaded. The configuration is optional and will only
                  be transferred from the[INITIALIZE] section if initiated
                  centrally.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the module in the following format:
                  &lt;PRODUCER-MODULE/VERSION&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void destroy() {
                  ...

                  The module is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h2>HTTP Modules</h2>
        <p>
          HTTP Modules are an extension of the Seanox Devwex Module API
          specifically designed for filtering, accepting and processing HTTP
          requests that run in the context of the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTTP modules allow you to implement filter and service
          functionalities, which is described in detail below, based on
          individual implementations that can also be combined in an HTTP
          module.
        </p>
        <h3>Filters</h3>
        <p>
          Access to the physical and virtual hosts can be controlled by
          specially defined rules: In addition to forwarding and responding to
          requests with a defined server status, processing can also be passed
          to a filter.<br>
          Filters are intended for checking specific requests and, if necessary,
          manipulating incoming requests; they should only have access to the
          request header if the request is not completely processed by the
          filter.
        </p>
        <h4>API (XAPI+)</h4>
        <p>
          The API corresponds to the Module API, which is extended by
          <code>Module.filter(Worker worker, String options)</code>. The passed
          worker is the request processing instance and has access to the
          server, socket, request, response, configuration and environment. With
          the configuration you can set further parameters and options for a
          filter, which are then optionally passed as string.
        </p>
        <h4>Implementation</h4>
        <pre>
          public class Module {

              public Module(String options) {
                  ...

                  The module is initiated via this constructor. If this is not
                  available, the module is considered incompatible with the API
                  and is not loaded. The configuration is optional and will only
                  be transferred from the[INITIALIZE] section if initiated
                  centrally.
              }

              public String explain() {
                  ...

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the module in the following format:
                  &lt;PRODUCER-MODULE/VERSION&gt;, which should be set
                  statically or with initialization.
              }

              public void filter(Worker worker, String options) {
                  ...

                  This method takes over the check and, if necessary, the
                  manipulation of the request or processes and completely
                  answers it. If the request is to be answered with a server
                  status only, the filter method can set it and does not have to
                  answer the request itself. In this case, the answer is
                  provided by the initial worker implementation.
              }

              public void destroy() {
                  ...

                  The module is requested to close before being unloaded by the
                  service and ClassLoader. The resources, data streams and
                  processes initiated or used by the module should be closed or
                  terminated with this call.
              }
          }
        </pre>
        <h3>Service</h3>
        <p>
          The target of an HTTP request these are directories, files and dynamic
          content from external CGI and XCGI applications that are requested via
          virtual paths.<br>
          Services provide another form of dynamic content. These take over the
          complete processing of incoming requests and have unrestricted access.
        </p>
        <h4>API (XAPI+)</h4>
        <p>
          The API corresponds to the Module API, which is extended by
          <code>Module.service(Worker worker, String options)</code>. The passed
          worker is the request processing instance and has access to the
          server, socket, request, response, configuration and environment. With
          the configuration, further parameters and options can be set for a
          module, which are then optionally passed as string.
        </p>
        <h4>Implementation</h4>

          public class Module {

              public Module(String options) {
                  ...

                  The module is initiated via this constructor. If this is not
                  available, the module is considered incompatible with the API
                  and is not loaded. The configuration is optional and will only
                  be transferred from the[INITIALIZE] section if initiated

                  This method is optional and returns general information about
                  the module in the following format:

                  This method takes over the complete processing of the request
                  and answers it. If the request is to be answered with a server
                  status only, the service method can set this status and does
                  not have to answer the request itself. In this case, the
                  answer is provided by the initial worker implementation.

        </pre>
        <h2>Cascaded Components</h2>
        <p>
          The binding of components is based on the concatenation of calls
          instead of inheritance. This allows e.g. the use of different
          constructors and the insertion of additional ClassLoader.<br>
          Inheritance can still be used, even in combination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The function is available for modules (XAPI) and servers (SAPI) and is
          defined directly with the configuration of the extension.<br>
          The cascade is described separately by the arrow symbol.   
        </p>

        <h2>Development Environment (SDK)</h2>
        <p>
          For development and experimenting with Seanox Devwex, a special
          development environment (SDK) is available (for Seanox Devwex 5.x in
          development). The completely pre-configured project for the Eclipse
          IDE includes Seanox Devwex, Seanox Devwex Test, Seanox Commons and
          Seanox Devwex WebSocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to a comprehensive API, including the necessary interfaces
          as well as abstractions and additional ClassLoader layers for the
          development with Seanox Devwex, many functional examples are also
          included. Detailed documentation is included with the development
          environment.
