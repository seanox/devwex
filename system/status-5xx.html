      <p>
        Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which
        the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
        request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include
        an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether
        it is a temporary or permanent condition. User agents SHOULD display any
        included entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any
        request method.
      </p>
      <p class="500"> 
        The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling
        the request.
      </p>
      <p class="501"> 
        The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
        This is the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the
        request method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
      </p>  
      <p class="502"> 
        The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response
        from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the request.
      </p> 
      <p class="503"> 
        The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary
        overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is
        a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known,
        the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no
        Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would
        for a 500 response.
      </p>  
      <p class="504"> 
        The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely
        response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP,
        LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in attempting
        to complete the request.
