      Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which
      the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
      request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD
      include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and
      whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. User agents SHOULD
      display any included entity to the user. These response codes are
      applicable to any request method.
    </p>
    <p class="500">
      The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from
      fulfilling the request.
    </p>
    <p class="501">
      The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the
      request. This is the appropriate response when the server does not
      recognize the request method and is not capable of supporting it for any
      resource.
    </p>
    <p class="502">
      The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid
      response from the upstream server it accessed in attempting to fulfill the
      request.
    </p>
    <p class="503">
      The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary
      overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is
      a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known,
      the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no
      Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would
      for a 500 response.
    </p>
    <p class="504">
      The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely
      response from the upstream server specified by the URI (e.g. HTTP, FTP,
      LDAP) or some other auxiliary server (e.g. DNS) it needed to access in
      attempting to complete the request.
