> [!NOTE]
> The package does not contain a JRE. If one is already installed. This must be
> found via the environment variables `PATH` and/or `JAVA_HOME`. Alternatively,
> the JRE can also be placed in `./runtime/java` so that the batch script finds
> the JRE automatically.


## Java Runtime Environment
The Java runtime environment can be downloaded here:

- https://oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads
- https://adoptium.net/
- https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/download
- https://microsoft.com/openjdk
- https://azul.com/downloads/#zulu
- https://bell-sw.com/libericajdk/
- https://aws.amazon.com/corretto
- https://jdk.java.net/

After downloading, the JRE can be installed or or without installation unpacked
to `../runtime/java`, where it is automatically found by the start script.


## Windows Service
To install as a Windows service, a package with [Apache Procrun](
    https://commons.apache.org/daemon/procrun.html) is available based on the
Java binary, which also contains service runners for 32 and 64 bit, as well as
the batch file `service.cmd` for easy use of the service.

Also the Windows package is unpacked at an arbitrary place in the file system.
Because the service should run with a Windows service account and appropriate
access rights, a place outside the user profiles is recommended for unpacking
and installation. By default, the Windows service account `NetworkService` is
used, which can be changed in `service.cmd`. The required access rights for the
program directory are set automatically during installation.

The parameters for configuring the service are centralized in the batch file and
easily accessible.

To install the service, the batch file `service.cmd`is used. To do this, open
the console (shell/command prompt) as administrator and change to the program
directory `./devwex/program` and call the batch file with the desired function.

`usage: service.cmd [command]`
