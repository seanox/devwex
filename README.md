Description
====

Seanox Devwex is a minimalistic container with a modular architecture for web servers
and applications. The already contained servers instances support the HTTP amongst
others virtual hosts, IP/Port sharing, filters, modules, SSL/TLS, XCGI/CGI1.1, file
listing and a on telnet based remote access to control the server. Further servers
and modules/applications can be integrated about the available APIs. The container
and server is a pure Java implementation for the command line and can be used with
an appropriate Java runtime environment on many operating systems.
